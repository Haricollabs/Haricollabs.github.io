  <h1>Hi There 👋🏼</h1>
  <p>I'm a Data Engineer focused on Databricks and Azure Data Services–centered solutions. I’ve worked across both OLTP and OLAP systems, gaining hands-on experience in designing scalable data architectures. My exposure to the Life Sciences & Bio-Pharma domain 🧬 has been enriching, and I’m eager to explore the BFSI domain 💼📊. PySpark and SQL have been my playground 💻, and I genuinely enjoy solving data challenges with them. Databricks has always stood out to me as a powerful, all-in-one centralized platform ✨.</p>

<p>In a recent Bio-Pharma–based engagement, I worked independently to deliver an OLAP system tailored for marketing data exploration 📈🔍. It was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of domain-specific analytics and reinforced my love for building impactful data solutions. I'm constantly learning—because what’s cutting-edge today might be obsolete tomorrow. Staying updated is not just a habit, it’s a mindset.</p>

<p>Not a perfect guy, but someone who shows up every day to chase his dreams 🌱🛤️. The journey continues, and I’m excited to keep growing both technically and personally.

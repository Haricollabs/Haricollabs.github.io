  <h1>Hi There 👋🏼</h1>
  <p>Hi There 👋🏼</p>

<p>I'm a Data Engineer focused on Databricks and Azure Data Services–centered solutions currently. I have soaked my hands in both OLTP and OLAP solutions . I have good exposure to the Life Sciences & Bio-Pharma domain 🧬, and the BFSI domain is in my bucket list to work on 💼📊. </p>

<p>I’ve been playing with PySpark and SQL all along & love doing that 💻. I’ve always loved Databricks as an all-in-one centralized platform ✨.</p>

<p>In a recent engagement with a Bio-Pharma–based project, I worked as an independent developer to successfully deliver an OLAP system for marketing data exploration 📈🔍.</p>

<p>I'm always open to learning new skills as what better today might get outdated if not updated. Not a perfect guy, but a guy working everyday to become what he dreams of and the journey continues 🌱🛤️</p>
